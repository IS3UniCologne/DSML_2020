    "# `DSML Workshop 14` - Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we provide a very short introduction to neural networks in Python. This is very far from a comprehensive coverage of the topic but can provide a quick start for those who wish to learn more about the topic in their own time. We will cover a classification and a regression taks using `keras` as our python package of choice. If you want to try and implement a NN from scratch there are several good online tutorials that can help you do so (see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6) for example). \n",

    "Dendrites are connecting to the axons (or \"outputs\") of other neurons, for instance nerves in the sensory system or other processing neurons. In the nucleus, these input signals are aggregated and forwarded through the axon. The axon terminals then connect to further neurons to build the neural network. The connection between axon terminal and dendrite is what we are calling a synapse. In the human brain, there are billions of neurons and $10^{14} - 10^{15}$ synapses in the human brain. If each synapse (or more precisely, its connection strength) would be represented by 8 bits or one byte, just storing these numbers would take 1000 TB already. "

    "To recreate neural networks artificially, neurons have to be defined. The common mathematical model used for this purpose is depicted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](math_neuron.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "From a certain number of input synapses $x_i$, signals come in with a weight factor of $w_i$. This represents the strength of the synapse. In the _nuclues_ these weighted inputs are aggregated and a bias is added. (The bias is not shown in every model, but it does make the neural network more generalizable). After adding of the weighted inputs and the bias, everything is fed into a (non-linear) activation function. The output is then either fed forward to further neurons or is the output of your neural network. If there is only one neuron that takes direct inputs and whose output is your interest, the model is called a single-layer perceptron. Many of these neurons can create almost arbitrary logical connections and functions, making ANNs very powerful. In this case, we are talking about a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model. \n",

    "### Activation Function\n",
    "The activation function is (to some degree) the hear of the neural network. Without a non-linear activation function, all hidden layers do not add any value, but are instead a complicated way to represent a liner model. Only with a non-linear activation function, ANNs can recreate non-linear hypothesis functions. In the beginning of research on the ANNs in the scope of AI, typically a unit step was used as activation function. The unit step is $0$ for inputs smaller than $0$ and $1$ otherwise. The idea behing this is to recreate the behavior of a biological neuron that _fires_ if a certain threshold of inputs is exceeded. Today, other activation functions are more typically used. This is linked to better mathematical qualities in terms of learning behavior and convergence. Some of the most popular activation functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid: $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1+exp(-z)}$\n",

    "As learning of ANNs is a non-trivial mathematical task, we are only aiming for an intuitive understanding here. Let's have a look at our complete MLP first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general learning tasks consists of two steps, which are repeated until the algorithm converges:\n",
    "1. __Feedforward: Calculating the predicted output ŷ and the associated loss__. At first, we randomly assign values for the weights (and the biases). Based on the input features, the output value is calculated.\n",
    "2. __Backpropagation: Updating the weights W and biases b__. If the output value and the target value differ, the weights and biases are updated. To do this, it is calculated how much each weight and bias contributes to the error. Proportionally to this, they are then corrected (scaled with a small learning factor). In this sense, the updating rule has some similarity to gradient descent, only that is is propagated through the entire network, which is why this algorithm is called backpropagation.\n",

    "4. Activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of hidden layers and number of nodes (its activation function could be understood as a hyperparameter, but that is typically not done). The more layers and nodes there are (and the denser the network is, i.e. the more edges have a non-zero weight) the harder it gets to learn the model. That's the reason why bigger ANNs are normally not trained on a local computer anymore, but on specialized computers. Furthermore, there are additional libraries for python to improve the efficiency of ANNs, e.g. TensorFlow or Keras, which we take a first look at in today's tutorial\n"

The logic is exactly the same, yet some of the parameters, such as loss, metrics, input and ouput as well as typical activation functions might have to be adapted to the specific case. We will not cover ANN regression in this tutorial, which is simply meant as an introduction to the topic.
